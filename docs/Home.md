**RNA** is a set of plugins for popular bundlers, servers and test runners. It can be used programmatically in your configuration or via the pluggable `rna` cli.

### ðŸ“¦ Transpiling and bundling

The RNA ecosystem is heavily based on [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), *an extremely fast JavaScript bundler* that supports TypeScript and CSS out of the box. Thanks to its plugin system, we added support for:

* **HTML entrypoints.** Using a `index.html` file as entrypoint, you can bundle your full web application. RNA will bundle and transpile referenced scripts and styles, along with copying external file resources and generating webmanifest and favicons.
* **Assets managment.** Collect files in your scripts using standard syntax and `URL` references.
* **CSS postprocessing.** If the project provides a configuration, any CSS file will be transformed by PostCSS.
* **CSS in node modules.** Import CSS dependencies from the node_modules folder using the node resolution algorithm and looking for the `style` field in package.json.
* **ES5 support.** Esbuild does not support lowering to ES5 syntax, that's why RNA provides a Babel plugin and beta SWC support.
